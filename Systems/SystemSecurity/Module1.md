what's the notion of system? a dynamically changing subject. If you are hard-coding your thinking into any particular system, you lose the flexibility.

When things evolve rapidly, one needs a stable frame of reference to truly understand the principles and anticipate future directions.



"参照系"

Probably AI is fast. We need to use AI, we need to embrace AI. But also, we need to look beyond the AI, right? If you zoom, we are turning in the middle of the ways, right? But if you zoom out, AI is just part of the computing history, there's a future better than the AI.

So if you look from that point of view, What is most stable over the years? Exactly, you look from the CPU up. It's very stable. Windows has been there. Linux has been there for many years.

怎么理解systems

it's not a rule, it's actually a demand, you feel the needs, and then you can things flow through the system stack.

## What is a System?

A **platform** supporting program **execution**.

## Execution on CPU (Memory errors)

### Basics:  x86 Machine Model 

In CPU, there are internal memory, which is called registers.
